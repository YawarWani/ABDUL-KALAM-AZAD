          Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam BR (/ˈɑːbdəl kəˈlɑːm/ ⓘ; 15
          October 1931 – 27 July 2015) was an Indian aerospace scientist and
          statesman who served as the 11th president of India from 2002 to 2007.
          He was born and raised in Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu and studied physics
          and aerospace engineering. He spent the next four decades as a
          scientist and science administrator, mainly at the Defence Research
          and Development Organisation (DRDO) and Indian Space Research
          Organisation (ISRO) and was intimately involved in India's civilian
          space programme and military missile development efforts.[1] He thus
          came to be known as the Missile Man of India for his work on the
          development of ballistic missile and launch vehicle
          technology.[2][3][4] He also played a pivotal organisational,
          technical, and political role in India's Pokhran-II nuclear tests in
          1998, the first since the original nuclear test by India in 1974.[5]
          Kalam was elected as the 11th president of India in 2002 with the
          support of both the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party and the
          then-opposition Indian National Congress. Widely referred to as the
          "People's President",[6] he returned to his civilian life of
          education, writing and public service after a single term. He was a
          recipient of several prestigious awards, including the Bharat Ratna,
          India's highest civilian honour. While delivering a lecture at the
          Indian Institute of Management Shillong, Kalam collapsed and died from
          an apparent cardiac arrest on 27 July 2015, aged 83.[7] Thousands,
          including national-level dignitaries, attended the funeral ceremony
          held in his hometown of Rameswaram, where he was buried with full
          state honours.[8]
